Our work on [PolyVer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03207) was accepted to FMCAD 2025! In this work, we present PolyVer, a novel framework for automated polyglot system verification that orchestrates multiple verification tools with the help of large language models (LLMs). We are able to verify real systems implemented in [Lingua Franca](https://www.lf-lang.org/)!
