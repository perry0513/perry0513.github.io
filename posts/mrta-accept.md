We are excited to announce that our research on SMT-based Multi-Robot Task Allocation (MRTA) has been accepted for presentation at the NASA Formal Methods 2024! In this work, we demonstrated that SMT-based techniques outperform previous methods in scalability for MRTA while providing strong feasibility guarantees.
