# Profile

My name is Pei-Wei Chen. 
I am a PhD student in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences working with [Sanjit A. Seshia](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~sseshia/) at the [University of California, Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/).
I completed my Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering at [National Taiwan University](https://www.ntu.edu.tw/english/), advised by [Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](https://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/).

My PhD research mainly lies in [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods), [automated reasoning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automated_reasoning), and neuro-symbolic approaches for them.
During my undergrad I focused on [Electronic Design Automation (EDA)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_design_automation) and automated reasononing.

Here is my [CV]() and [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Dag0G5AAAAAJ&hl=en). You can reach me at [pwchen@berkeley.edu](mailto:pwchen@berkeley.edu).
