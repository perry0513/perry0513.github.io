I am an undergraduate student at [NTUEE](https://web.ee.ntu.edu.tw/eng/index.php), and will be obtaining my B.S. degree in Janaury 2021.
I am currently applying for Fall 2021 graduate schools.

During my undergraduate, I worked with [Prof. Jie-Hong Roland Jiang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~jhjiang/) and [Prof. Yao-Wen Chang](http://cc.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~ywchang/) on decision procedures and electronic design automation.
I also worked with [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](http://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~tlkagk/index.html) and [Prof. Yi-Chang Lu](https://sites.google.com/view/ldps-giee-ntu/home/advisor) on machine learning and hardware accelerators.

My research interest is in design automation, decision procedures, and formal methods.
